          <h2>Spring</h2>
          <p>
            The first concerto of the Four Seasons is Spring. Spring is a solo concerto with 3 movements: quick, slow,
            quick. The first movement includes birdsong and a spring storm; the second a shepherd who sleeps with his
            faithful dog by his side and the third is a lively spring dance.

          <h2>Summer</h2>
          <p>
            It's a poem about the season's blazing heat. The intense, lazy heat begins to be replaced by a cool and
            refreshing breeze, accompanied by various singing birds. However, minor chords and dramatic undertones warn
            us that this breeze could turn into a storm.

          <h2>Autumn</h2>
          <p>
            Autumn makes a return to the clarity resembling “Spring,” with similar musical themes in the first
            movements. The country folk rejoice once again, celebrating the harvest by drinking wine. The tempo drops
            significantly, in parallel to the peaceful sleep that engulfs the people.

          <h2>Winter</h2>
          <p>
            Winter is the last of four violin concertos that comprise Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. The outer movements
            musically describe wintry scenes like falling snow, chilling wind gusts, slipping on the ice and even the
            sound of our teeth chattering due to the intense cold!
